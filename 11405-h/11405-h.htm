      COUNCIL OFFICE, &amp;c. WHITEHALL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      From the Druids' Temple, at Abury, (our last engraving,) to
      the Council Office, at Whitehall, is a long stride in the
      march of time. From "grave to gay, and lively to severe," is
      nothing to it; but variety is the public dictum; and with
      more sincerity than the courtier in <i>Tom Thumb</i>, we say
      to the public,
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "Whate'er your majesty shall please to name,
        </p>
        <p>
          Long cut or short cut, to us' tis all the same."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      On the annexed page is represented the new splendid range of
      buildings, including the <i>Council Office</i>, <i>Board of
      Trade</i>, &amp;c. at Whitehall. The architect, Mr. Soane,
      has adapted the fa&ccedil;ade from the Temple of Jupiter
      Stator, at Rome.<a id="footnotetag1"
      name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Soane's adaptation has been only partial, and he has
      adhered merely to the details of the columns and entablature.
      "The fa&ccedil;ade," it is well observed in an early Number
      of the <i>Athenaeum</i>, "enjoys one of the most favourable
      sites for the display of a public building which the
      metropolis affords; no limit has been set to the expense; the
      finest materials the country yields have been used in its
      construction; the richest example of the richest order which
      antiquity has left us, has been lavishly employed in its
      decoration; and yet," continues the critic, "is not the whole
      a failure?" He then describes the effect of it as "poor, or
      at best but pretty," and attributes the absence of grandeur
      to the "want of sufficient elevation."&mdash;"To the general
      elevation it may be objected, that it has no prominent
      centre; that, composed of two wings and an intermediate space
      receding, it has more the character of a flank than a front
      building; and that the want of a central entrance derogates
      greatly from its dignity as a principal fa&ccedil;ade."
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are mere amateurs in these matters, and it will be as
      well to leave the remainder of this criticism to the more
      studious reader. We have, however, glanced at the principal
      defects which the writer in the <i>Athenaeum</i> points out,
      and we are bound to admit the justice of his remarks. The
      details which produce this effect would not be so generally
      interesting. "The order itself," says he, "it must be
      admitted, is well copied, and excellently executed;" but Mr.
      Soane's application of it is loudly censured&mdash;a Roman
      temple being inappropriate for a British Council Office.
      Perhaps our critic would have preferred a fa&ccedil;ade like
      that of the Palais de Justice at Paris,&mdash;a platform,
      ascended by an immense flight of steps, which serves as a
      basement for a projecting body of four Doric columns; with
      four large pedestals in front, and statues of
      <i>Strength</i>, <i>Plenty</i>, <i>Justice</i>, and
      <i>Prudence</i>, as the cardinal virtues of English
      legislation and trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the whole, we cannot help thinking some of the details
      of this new range extremely rich and pleasing, although we
      assent to the above character of their general effect. The
      columns, of fluted Corinthian, and the cornice of the order,
      are to us very beautiful; but the upper windows are
      unsightly, or, as a wag would say, purely attic; and the
      entrances are too strictly <i>official</i> for the
      architecture of the building. This brings us again to the
      inappropriateness of the adaptation, which made these
      introductions unavoidable.<a id="footnotetag2"
      name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The front of the building is not completed, the northern wing
      having yet to be erected. When this is finished, the effect
      may be materially assisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we are in this quarter, and lest "we may never come
      again," it may be as well to thank our correspondent, "An
      Architect," for his letter on "Whitehall," a very small
      portion of which has ever been completed. What has been
      finished&mdash;the Banqueting House&mdash;is one of the
      triumphs of Inigo Jones, but like all human works, is sadly
      dilapidated; although this is attributable to the bad
      material, rather than to the interval since its erection. The
      <i>whole</i> was, indeed, a magnificent design.

      CROMLECH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In No. 328 of the MIRROR, you mistake in spelling
      <i>cromlech</i>; the last syllable is always written
      <i>lech</i>, not <i>leh</i>; neither is it derived from
      <i>crom</i> and <i>leac</i>, the Irish, but from <i>crom</i>
      and <i>llech</i>, the Celtic, of which the Irish is the most
      corrupted, and the present Welsh the most pure dialect.
      <i>Llech</i> signifies a stone in Welsh, and is pronounced in
      a way peculiar to the Welsh; when simple it is <i>llech</i>,
      when compounded <i>lech</i>.

      GARDEN OF HYACINTHS
    </h3>
    <center>
      IN THE SERAGLIO, CONSTANTINOPLE.

    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      In this garden the sultan passes most of his leisure hours,
      free from the outward parade attendant on his rank. It is
      small, but tastefully disposed in oblong beds, edged with
      fine porcelain; no plant is allowed to grow in it except the
      hyacinth; whence the name of the garden and the apartment it
      contains. Nothing can be more beautiful than the interior;
      three sides are formed by a divan, the cushions and pillows
      of which were of black satin, exquisitely embroidered. The
      floor was covered with Gobelin tapestry, and the ceiling
      magnificently gilded and burnished. Opposite the windows of
      the chamber was a fire-place, in the European manner; and on
      each side a door, covered with hangings of crimson cloth.
      Between each of these doors appeared a glass-case, containing
      the sultan's private library; every volume was in manuscript,
      with the name written on the edges of the leaves. Opposite
      the doors and fire-place hung three gold cages, containing
      artificial birds, which sang by mechanism. On one side was a
      raised bench, on which was placed an embroidered towel, a
      splendid vase, and basin for washing the hands and beard;
      upon the wall over it was suspended an embroidered portfolio,
      worked with silver on yellow leather, to contain the
      petitions presented to the sultan when he goes in procession
      to the mosque. Close to the door was placed a pair of yellow
      boots and slippers, which are always at the entrance of every
      apartment frequented by the sultan. Groups of arms, such as
      pistols, sabres, and poniards, were displayed with great
      taste and effect on the compartments of the walls; the
      handles were covered with diamonds and jewels of large size,
      which, as they glittered around, gave an almost dazzling
      brilliancy to this sumptuous chamber, thus characterizing the
      amusements of the man when divested of the ceremony and
      formality of the sultan.

      LOCUSTS AND WILD HONEY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It has not been till lately that any of the travellers into
      Palestine have told what was meant by the locusts mentioned
      by St. Matthew as part of the food of John the Baptist. Dr.
      Clarke first related, that a tree grows in the Holy Land,
      which is called the locust tree, and produces an eatable
      fruit; but this fact was well known to many who had been in
      the Mediterranean. The tree grows in several of the countries
      which border that sea. It has been found in much greater
      abundance in some parts of the East Indies, whence it has now
      become an article of export. Many thousands of its pods are
      annually imported by the East India Company; and, either
      because the fruit is richer in more southern climates, or for
      some other reason, a great quantity of them are shipped for
      Venice and Trieste, where there is distilled from them a
      liquor, which is supposed to be an antidote to the plague, or
      at least useful in curing it. These pods are about twenty
      inches long, and from half to three-quarters of an inch in
      diameter. We call them pods for want of a term which would
      more accurately describe them; but they are not flat, neither
      have they that sort of hinge on one side, and slight
      fastening on the other, which plainly show how the shells of
      peas and beans are to be opened. On the contrary, these are
      round; but there are two opposite lines along them, where the
      colour alone would induce any one to suppose the skin to be,
      as it is, thinner than elsewhere. Having the fruit before us
      only in a dry state, we can describe it in no other; but at
      present a knife could scarcely be made to penetrate the
      thicker part, and does not very easily make its way into the
      thinner. The fruit, which lies in little cells within, is a
      pulp, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page340"
      name="page340"></a>[pg 340]</span> or paste, somewhat like
      that of tamarinds, but smoother, and not so sweet. There are
      pips in it nearly as hard, and about half as large, as those
      of a tamarind, containing a kernel in each. It should be
      added, that in the stems of this locust tree wild bees still
      deposit their honey.

      FLOWERS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      On reading the MIRROR, No. 337, my attention was attracted to
      one of your many pleasant and amusing extracts from the
      "Public Journals," bearing the title of "Flowers." Being
      myself a great admirer of that beautiful and delightful part
      of creation, I was led to peruse the article with somewhat
      increased attention. In all ages flowers have been regarded
      with peculiar sympathy; they have been associated with the
      calm serenity of virtue; they have been strewed around the
      altars of devotion; have been made to accompany the lonely,
      unobtrusive works of merit; and hung around the grave of
      faded and departed innocence, thus silently, but powerfully,
      depicting virtue, the essence of felicity. Although I do not
      consider you to be accountable for statements contained in
      the articles extracted from other journals, still I presume
      you would not knowingly make your work the vehicle of any
      matter which would lead your readers astray. I have,
      therefore, ventured to call your attention to a particular
      part of the above article, and to correct what I presume to
      be a misstatement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the article alluded to, the writer states, "It has been
      said that flowers placed in bed-rooms are not wholesome; that
      cannot," he remarks, "be meant of such as are in a state of
      vegetation," &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now plants, it is well known, respire similarly to animals,
      through the pores of their leaves. By the agency of the sun,
      during the day, a quantity of pure gas, called oxygen, is
      given out; but on the contrary, during the night, or absence
      of the sun, gas of a most noxious and pernicious nature is
      emitted, and at the same time a portion of the pure air
      (oxygen gas) is absorbed. The greater part of the atmosphere
      must therefore be impregnated with this deleterious gas.
      Taking into consideration the confined state of a
      bed-chamber, the great increase of perspiration of the body,
      with the continual increase of carbonic gas from respiration,
      and this in an apartment where every thing <i>ought</i> most
      sedulously to be avoided which in the least tends to
      deteriorate the atmosphere, it must be evident the practice
      ought to be avoided, if we are desirous of preserving health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flowers in a state of vegetation are, I consider, more
      pernicious <i>at night</i>, or during the absence of the sun,
      than those plucked and put into water, provided they be not
      immersed too long a time; for immediately the stem is severed
      from the plant, the vital action, if it may be so termed,
      ceases, and decomposition commences; but till the
      decomposition has been going on some time, nothing of a
      pernicious nature need be apprehended. In like manner,
      directly the vital principle becomes extinct in animals,
      decomposition ensues. For the space of five or six days,
      however, no perceptible alteration of the fibres is visible;
      but after that time a compound of gases begins to exhale from
      the body, accompanied with a fetid odour, till the parts are
      entirely decomposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effluvium arising from the <i>farina</i> and
      <i>petals</i> is considered unwholesome, however agreeable it
      may be to the senses, whether the plant be in a state of
      vegetation or not, it being too powerful for the olfactory
      nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      S.S.T.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our pages are always open to the correction of our readers,
      and in this instance we thank <i>S.S.T.</i> for the above,
      although we think he has misconceived some portion of the
      article on "Flowers," the writer adding to that passage
      quoted by our correspondent, "<i>provided fresh air is
      frequently introduced</i>"; of course, he does not refer to
      the <i>night-time</i>, although it would have been clearer,
      had he suggested the removal of flowers from bed-rooms during
      the night.&mdash;ED.

    <h3>
      CIRCULAR TEMPLES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      These structures are generally supposed to have been built
      with astronomical allusions, especially the noble temple at
      <i>Stonehenge</i>. Circular temples existed among the
      Israelites. In Exodus, c. xxiv. v. 4, it is written that
      "Moses rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar
      under the hill, and twelve pillars." Again in Joshua, iv. 9,
      Joshua set up twelve stones; and it is well worthy of remark,
      that the twelve pillars of Moses and Joshua correspond with
      the number of stones of the inner circles at Abury. It is
      possible that these stones were plastered over, and probably
      highly ornamented, as in Deuteronomy, xxvii. 2, we read,
      "Thou shalt set thee up great stones, and plaster them with
      plaster;" and there is a large, upright stone in Ireland,
      which, according to the legend of the country, was once
      covered over with gold. On some of these
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>[pg
      341]</span> pillars it is likewise probable that certain
      characters were traced, as among the Israelites words of the
      law were written upon similar obelisks or columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest temples in Greece were formed of obeliscal
      columns; and in some parts of Africa the custom obtains to
      this day. Hence the pillars of our present temples are the
      most ancient; and subsequent builders of holy sanctuaries
      filled up the intercolumniations till the temples were
      constructed as we now see their ruins in Athens and
      elsewhere. But many of the early temples were round; and it
      is a curious fact, hitherto unnoticed, I believe, that the
      altar end, the sanctum of our earliest Saxon churches, is
      circular.

      spirit of the offended saint to perform the voluntary penance
      of quitting the kingdom in thirty days. He obeyed this
      intimation, and immediately left Norway. Having conquered
      many of the Western Isles, at length he established himself
      in the Isle of Man. Afterwards attempting the reduction of
      Ireland, he was surrounded by the natives and slain, with the
      whole of his followers.]

    <h3>
      A LIVING ALCHEMIST.
    </h3>
    <center>
      (<i>From Sir R. Phillips's Tour</i>.)
    </center>
    <p>
      At Luton, Beds. Sir Richard hears of an ALCHEMIST, who lives
      at the village of Lilley, midway between Luton and Hitchen.
      The whole of his interview with this eccentric personage,
      will doubtless be interesting to our readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was four miles out of my road, but I thought a modern
      alchemist worthy of a visit, particularly as several
      inhabitants of Luton gravely assured me, that he had
      succeeded in discovering the Philosopher's Stone, and also
      the Universal Solvent. The reports about him would have
      rendered it culpable not to have hazarded anything for a
      personal interview. I learnt that he had been a man of
      fashion, and at one time largely concerned in adventures on
      the turf, but that for many years he had devoted himself to
      his present pursuits; while for some time past, he had been
      inaccessible and invisible to the world, the house being shut
      and barricadoed, and the walls of his grounds protected by
      hurdles, with spring-guns so planted as to resist intrusion
      in every direction. Under these circumstances, I had no
      encouragement to go to Lilley, but I thought that even the
      external inspection of such premises would repay me for the
      trouble. At Lilley, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page342"
      name="page342"></a>[pg 342]</span> I inquired for his house
      of various people, and they looked ominous; some smiled,
      others shook their heads, and all appeared surprised at the
      approach of an apparent visiter to Mr. Kellerman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of the premises did not belie vulgar report. I
      could not help shuddering at seeing the high walls of
      respectable premises, lined at the top with double tiers of
      hurdles, and on driving my chaise to the front of the house,
      I perceived the whole in a state of horrid dilapidation.
      Contrary, however, to my expectation, I found a young man who
      appeared to belong to the out-buildings, and he took charge
      of my card for his master, and went to the back part of the
      house to deliver it. The front windows on the ground-floor
      and upper stories were entirely closed by inside shutters,
      much of the glass was broken, and the premises appeared
      altogether as if deserted. I was pleased at the words, "My
      master will be happy to see you," and in a minute the front
      door was opened, and Mr. Kellerman presented himself.&mdash;I
      lament that I have not the pencil of Hogarth, for a more
      original figure never was seen. He was about six feet high,
      and of athletic make; on his head was a white night-cap, and
      his dress consisted of a long great-coat once green, and he
      had a sort of jockey waistcoat with three tiers of pockets.
      His manner was extremely polite and graceful, but my
      attention was chiefly absorbed by his singular physiognomy.
      His complexion was deeply sallow, and his eyes large, black,
      and rolling. He conducted me into a very large parlour, with
      a window looking backward, and having locked the door, and
      put the key in his pocket, he desired me to be seated in one
      of two large arm chairs covered with sheepskins. The room was
      a realization of the well-known picture of Teniers'
      Alchemist. The floor was covered with retorts, crucibles,
      alembics, jars, bottles in various shapes, intermingled with
      old books piled upon each other, with a sufficient quantity
      of dust and cobwebs. Different shelves were filled in the
      same manner, and on one side stood his bed. In a corner
      somewhat shaded from the light, I beheld two heads, white,
      with dark wigs on them; I entertained no doubt therefore,
      that among other fancies he was engaged in re-making the
      brazen speaking head of Roger Bacon and Albertus. Many
      persons might have felt alarmed at the peculiarity of my
      situation, but being accustomed to mingle with eccentric
      characters, and having no fear from any pretensions of the
      black art, I was infinitely gratified by all I saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having stated the reports which I had heard, relative to his
      wonderful discoveries, I told him frankly that mine was a
      visit of curiosity, and stated that if what I had heard was
      matter of fact, the researches of the ancient chemists had
      been unjustly derided. He then gave me a history of his
      studies, mentioned some men whom I had happened to know in
      London, who he alleged had assured him that they had made
      gold. That having in consequence examined the works of the
      ancient alchemists, and discovered the key which they had
      studiously concealed from the multitude, he had pursued their
      system under the influence of new lights; and after suffering
      numerous disappointments, owing to the ambiguity with which
      they described their processes, he had, at length, happily
      succeeded; had made gold, and could make as much more as he
      pleased, even to the extent of paying off the national debt
      in the coin of the realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      I yielded to the declaration, expressed my satisfaction at so
      extraordinary a discovery, and asked him, to oblige me so
      far, as to show me some of the precious metal which he had
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," said he; "I will show it to no one. I made Lord
      Liverpool the offer, that if he would introduce me to the
      king, I would show it to his majesty; but Lord Liverpool
      insolently declined, on the ground that there was no
      precedent; and I am therefore determined, that the secret
      shall die with me. It is true that, in order to avenge myself
      of such contempt, I made a communication to the French
      ambassador, Prince Polignac, and offered to go to France, and
      transfer to the French government, the entire advantages of
      the discovery; but after deluding me, and shuffling for some
      time, I found it necessary to treat him with the same
      contempt as the others."
    </p>
    <p>
      I expressed my convictions in regard to the double dealing of
      men in office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O," said he, "as to that, every court in Europe well knows
      that I have made the discovery, and they are all in
      confederacy against me; lest by giving it to any one, I
      should make that country master of all the rest&mdash;the
      world, Sir," he exclaimed with great emotion, "is in my hands
      and my power."
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied with this announcement of the discovery of the
      philosopher's stone, I now inquired about the sublime
      alkahest or universal solvent, and whether he had succeeded
      in deciphering the enigmatical descriptions of the ancient
      writers on that most curious topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," he replied, "I succeeded in that several years
      ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343"></a>[pg
      343]</span> "Then," I proceeded, "have you effected the other
      great desideratum, the fixing of mercury?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Than that process," said he, "there is nothing more easy; at
      the same time it is proper I should inform you, that there
      are a class of impostors, who mistaking the ancient writers,
      pretend it can be done by heat; but I can assure you, it can
      only be effected by water."
    </p>
    <p>
      I then besought him to do me the favour, to show me some of
      his fixed mercury, having once seen some which had been fixed
      by cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposition, however, he declined, because he said he
      had refused others. "That you may, however, be satisfied that
      I have made great discoveries, here is a bottle of oil, which
      I have purified, and rendered as transparent as spring water.
      I was offered &pound;10,000. for this discovery; but I am so
      neglected, and so conspired against, that I am determined it
      and all my other discoveries shall die with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      I now inquired, whether he had been alarmed by the ignorance
      of the people in the country, so as to shut himself up in so
      unusual a manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he replied, "not on their account wholly. They are
      ignorant and insolent enough; but it was to protect myself
      against the governments of Europe, who are determined to get
      possession of my secret by force. I have been," he exclaimed,
      "twice fired at in one day through that window, and three
      times attempted to be poisoned. They believed I had written a
      book containing my secrets, and to get possession of this
      book has been their object. To baffle them, I burnt all that
      I had ever written, and I have so guarded the windows with
      spring-guns, and have such a collection of combustibles in
      the range of bottles which stand at your elbow, that I could
      destroy a whole regiment of soldiers if sent against me." He
      then related, that as a further protection he lived entirely
      in that room, and permitted no one to come into the house;
      while he had locked up every room except that with patent
      padlocks, and sealed the key-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be tedious and impossible to follow Mr. Kellerman
      through a conversation of two or three hours, in which he
      enlarged upon the merits of the ancient alchemists, and on
      the blunders and impertinent assumptions of the modern
      chemists, with whose writings and names it is fair to
      acknowledge he seemed well acquainted. He quoted the
      authorities of Roger and Lord Bacon, Paracelsus, Boyle,
      Boerhaave, Woolfe, and others, to justify his pursuits. As to
      the term philosopher's stone, he alleged that it was a mere
      figure, to deceive the vulgar. He appeared also to give full
      credit to the silly story about Dee's assistant, Kelly,
      finding some of the powder of projection in the tomb of Roger
      Bacon at Glastonbury, by means of which, as was said, Kelly
      for a length of time supported himself in princely splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I inquired whether he had discovered the blacker than black
      of Apollonius Tyaneus; and this, he assured me, he had
      effected; it was itself the powder of projection for
      producing gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amidst all this delusion and illusion on these subjects, Mr.
      Kellerman behaved in other respects with great propriety and
      politeness; and having unlocked the door, he took me to the
      doors of some of the other rooms, to show me how safely they
      were padlocked; and on taking leave, directed me in my course
      towards Bedford.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, I overtook a man, and on inquiring what the
      people thought of Mr. Kellerman, he told me that he had lived
      with him for seven years; that he was one of eight assistants
      whom he kept for the purpose of superintending his crucibles,
      two at a time relieving each other every six hours; that he
      had exposed some preparations to intense heat for many months
      at a time, but that all except one crucible had burst, and
      that he called on him to observe, that it contained the true
      "blacker than black." The man protested, however, that no
      gold had ever been made, and that no mercury had ever been
      fixed; for he was quite sure, that if he had made any
      discovery, he could not have concealed it from the
      assistants; while, on the contrary, they witnessed his severe
      disappointments, at the termination of his most elaborate
      experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      On my telling the man that I had been in his room, he seemed
      much astonished at my boldness; for he assured me, that he
      carried a loaded pistol in every one of his six waistcoat
      pockets. I learnt also from this man, that he has or had
      considerable property in Jamaica; that he has lived in the
      premises at Lilley about twenty-three years, and during
      fourteen of them pursued his alchemical researches with
      unremitting ardour; but for the last few years shut himself
      up as a close prisoner, and lived in the manner I have
      described.

      Notes of a Reader.

    <h3>
      COURT OF CHARLES II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the last No. of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, there is an
      admirably written article on Hallam's "Constitutional
      History," not a mere essay, but somewhat more like a review
      than usual. It contains an abundance of florid, bold, and
      vigorous writing, extending through upwards of 70 pages.
      Among the most striking passages we notice a parallel between
      Cromwell and Napoleon, drawn with considerable force. But our
      extract is from the lighter portion, as the following
      ludicrous sketches of some of the enormities of Charles II.
      "Towards the close of the Protectorate, many signs indicated
      that a time of license was at hand. But the restoration of
      Charles II rendered the change wonderfully rapid and violent.
      A deep and general taint infected the morals of the most
      influential classes, and spread itself through every province
      of letters. Poetry inflamed the passions; philosophy
      undermined the principles; divinity itself, inculcating an
      abject reverence for the court, gave additional effect to its
      licentious example. ... The favourite duchess stamps about
      Whitehall, cursing and swearing. The ministers employ their
      time at the council board in making mouths at each other, and
      taking off each other's gestures for the amusement of the
      king. The peers at a conference begin to pommel each other,
      and to tear collars and periwigs. A speaker in the House of
      Commons gives offence to the court. He is way-laid by a gang
      of bullies, and his nose is cut to the bone. ... The second
      generation of the statesmen of this reign, were worthy of the
      schools in which they had been trained, of the gaming table
      of Grammont, and the tiring room of Nell &mdash;&mdash;."
      This is but a small portion of the good set terms in which
      the reviewer illustrates the licentiousness of the times.
      Speaking of Clarendon, he says, "Mr. Hallam scarcely makes
      sufficient allowance for the wear and tear which honesty
      almost necessarily sustains in the friction of political
      life, and which in times so rough as those through which
      Clarendon passed, must be very considerable. When these are
      fairly estimated, we think that his integrity may be allowed
      to pass muster." Perhaps political honesty is like Joseph
      Surface's French plate, or the tinsel spread over a pair of
      Birmingham saleshop candlesticks, whose tenderness will not
      withstand the wear and tear of conveyance in the purchaser's
      pocket. But the oddity of the reviewer's comparisons even
      puts one in good humour with their virulence.

      STREET SYMPATHIES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      During "the season" the veriest stranger who has an eye and
      ear, and thoughts, must find in London sufficient to occupy
      his attention; true, he may start and sigh, to think that of
      the busy and enormous multitude around him, not one would
      care, if, treading on yonder bit of orange peel, he should
      slip off the flagway, and falling beneath the wheel of that
      immense coal-wagon, have his thigh crushed to atoms, while
      you'd be saying "Jack Robinson." But if he do sigh, the more
      fool he; first, because "grieving's a folly," as the old sea
      song hath it; next because he is mistaken in supposing that
      no one would feel interested in his misfortune. There are two
      upon the very flagway with him, who would evince the greatest
      sympathy in his fate; the one is a surgeon's apprentice, who,
      with anxious care, would bear him off to <i>his</i> hospital,
      that he might "try his 'prentice hand" to doctor him while
      living, and dissect him when dead; and the other is a running
      reporter to one of the morning papers, who would with gentle
      and soothing accents inquire his name, condition, and abode,
      to swell the paragraph, and increase his
      pay.&mdash;<i>Blackwood's Magazine.</i>

      A LUCKY MATCH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The late Mr. Locke, of Norbury Park, commissioned one
      Jenkins, a dealer in pictures, residing at Rome, to send him
      any piece of sculpture which might not exceed fifty guineas.
      Jenkins sent a head of Minerva, which Mr. Locke, not liking,
      returned, paying the carriage, and all other expenses.
      Nollekens, who was then also at Rome, having purchased a
      trunk of Minerva for fifty pounds, upon the return of this
      head, found that its proportion and character accorded with
      his torso. This discovery induced him to accept an offer made
      by Jenkins of the head itself; and 220 guineas to share the
      profits. After Nollekens had joined the head and trunk, or,
      what is called "restored it," which he did at the expense of
      twenty guineas more for stone and labour, it proved a most
      fortunate hit, for they sold it for the enormous sum of 1,000
      guineas! and it is now at Newby, in

      NELSON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We received the following little anecdote from a letter of a
      gentleman now at the head of the medical profession, with
      which he favoured us shortly after perusing Salmonia. "I was
      (says our friend) at the Naval Hospital, at Yarmouth, on the
      morning when Nelson, after the battle of Copenhagen (having
      sent the wounded before him,) arrived at the Roads, and
      landed on the jutty. The populace soon surrounded him, and
      the military were drawn up in the market-place ready to
      receive him; but making his way through the crowd, and the
      dust, and the clamour, he went straight to the hospital. I
      went round the wards with him, and was much interested in
      observing his demeanour to the sailors; he stopped at every
      bed, and to every man he had something kind and cheering to
      say. At length, he stopped opposite a bed on which a sailor
      was lying who had lost his right arm close to the
      shoulder-joint, and the following short dialogue passed
      between, them:"&mdash;<i>Nelson</i>. "Well, Jack, what's the
      matter with you?"&mdash;<i>Sailor</i>. "Lost my right arm,
      your honour."&mdash;Nelson paused, looked down at his own
      empty sleeve, then at the sailor, and said playfully, "Well,
      Jack, then you and I are spoiled for fishermen&mdash;cheer
      up, my brave fellow." And he passed briskly on to the next
      bed; but these few words had a magical effect upon the poor
      fellow, for I saw his eyes sparkle with delight as Nelson
      turned away and pursued his course through the wards. As this
      was the only occasion on which I saw Nelson, I may, possibly,
      overrate the value of the incident.&mdash;<i>Q. Rev.</i>

      THE BRITISH ALMANAC.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This work, though only in its second year, is too well known
      to be benefited by our recommendation. As a compilation, with
      occasional originality, it is one of the best executed
      labours of the Society from whom it emanates, and who, from
      the multiplicity of facts here assembled, may be called "The
      Society for the" <i>Condensation</i> "of Useful Knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Almanac for 1829 we notice several improvements upon
      that of last year. The "Remarks on Weather" are valuable; and
      the "Garden Plants in Flower" in each month, in themselves
      extremely interesting, contrast the unchanging course of
      nature with the grand revolutions and events of the column of
      "Anniversaries." Thus, what different emotions are produced
      by reading April 6, "First Abdication of Bonaparte, 1814,"
      and "Primrose Peerless (<i>Narcissus biflorus</i>) in
      flower." The "Useful Remarks," though not a new feature in an
      almanac, are profitable helps to social duties, especially
      when drawn from such a source as Owen Feltham's
      Resolves&mdash;a golden treasury of world-knowledge, which
      may serve as a text-book for every family. Among the useful
      facts we notice the following:&mdash;"By a parliamentary
      return of the year 1828 we find that the stamp duty paid upon
      the almanacs of England amounts to 30,136<i>l</i>. 3<i>s</i>.
      9<i>d</i>.&mdash;which, the duty being <i>fifteen-pence</i>
      upon each almanac, exhibits a circulation of 451,593

      "There are only two months, namely, July and August, in

      temperature of 32&deg;."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The temperature of August is but little reduced, owing to
      the prevalence of hot nights. The action of the sun's rays is
      considerably assisted by the warm earth which radiates heat
      into the air; while, in spring, it absorbs every day a
      proportion of the heat which the sun produces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>October</i>&mdash;Now that the fruits of the earth are
      laid in store, the increase of wet is attended by no
      injurious effects, the remaining heat of the earth is
      preserved from needless expenditure, and guarded from
      dissipation, by an increasing canopy of clouds, by which the
      effect of radiation is greatly reduced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The comparative warmth of November is owing to the heat
      given out by the condensation of the vapour in the atmosphere
      into rain."

      A VISION OF PURGATORY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>By William Maginn, Esq.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The churchyard of Inistubber is as lonely a one as you would
      wish to see on a summer's day, or avoid on a winter's night.
      Under the east window of the church is a mouldering vault of
      the De Lacys,&mdash;a branch of a family descended from one
      of the conquerors of Ireland; and there they are buried, when
      the allotted time calls them to the tomb. Sir Theodore De
      Lacy had lived a jolly, thoughtless life, rising early for
      the hunt, and retiring late from the bottle. A good-humoured
      bachelor who took no care about the management of his
      household, provided that the hounds were in order for his
      going out, and the table ready on his coming in. As for the
      rest,&mdash;an easy landlord, a quiet master, a lenient
      magistrate (except to poachers,) and a very excellent foreman
      of a grand jury. He died one evening while laughing at a
      story which he had heard regularly thrice a week for the last
      fifteen years of his life, and his spirit mingled with the
      claret. In former times when the De Lacys were buried, there
      was a grand breakfast, and all the party rode over to the
      church to see the last rites paid. The keeners lamented; the
      country people had a wake before the funeral, and a dinner
      after it&mdash;and there was an end. But with the march of
      mind comes trouble and vexation. A man has now-a-days no
      certainty of quietness in his coffin&mdash;unless it be a
      patent one. He is laid down in the grave, and the next
      morning finds himself called upon to demonstrate an
      interesting fact! No one, I believe, admires this ceremony,
      and it is not to be wondered at that Sir Theodore De Lacy
      held it in especial horror. "I'd like," said he one evening,
      "to catch one of the thieves coming after me when I'm
      dead&mdash;By the God of War, I'd break every bone in his
      body;&mdash;but," he added with a sigh, "as I suppose I'll
      not be able to take my own part then, upon you I leave it,
      Larry Sweeney, to watch me three days and three nights after
      they plant me under the sod. There's Doctor Dickenson there,
      I see the fellow looking at me&mdash;fill your glass,
      Doctor&mdash;here's your health! and shoot him, Larry, do you
      hear, shoot the Doctor like a cock, if he ever comes stirring
      up my poor old bones from their roost of Inistubber." "Why,
      then," Larry answered, accepting the glass which followed
      this command, "long life to both your honours; and it's I
      that would like to be putting a bullet into Doctor
      Dickenson&mdash;heaven between him and harm&mdash;for hauling
      your honour away, as if you was a horse's head, to a bonfire.
      There's nothing, I 'shure you, gintlemin, poor as I am, that
      would give me greater pleasure." "We feel obliged, Larry"
      said Sir Theodore, "for your good wishes." "Is it I pull you
      out of the grave, indeed!" continued the whipper-in, for such
      he was, &mdash;"I'd let nobody pull your honour out of any
      place, saving 'twas purgatory; and out of that I'd pull you
      myself, if I saw you going <i>there</i>." "I am of opinion,
      Larry," said Doctor Dickenson, "you would turn tail if you
      saw Sir Theodore on that road. You might go further, and fare
      worse, you know." "Turn tail!" replied Larry, "it is I that
      wouldn't&mdash;I appale to St. Patrick himself over
      beyond"&mdash;pointing to a picture of the Prime Saint of
      Ireland, which hung in gilt daubery behind his master's
      chair, right opposite to him. To Larry's horror and
      astonishment, the picture fixing its eyes upon him, winked
      with the most knowing air, as if acknowledging the appeal.
      "What makes you turn so white then at the very thought," said
      the doctor, interpreting the visible consternation of our
      hero in his own way. "Nothing particular," answered Larry;
      "but a wakeness has come strong over me, gintlemin, and if
      you'd have no objection, I'd like to go into the air for a
      bit." Leave was of course granted, and Larry retired amid the
      laughter of the guests&mdash;but as he retreated, he could
      not avoid casting a glance on the awful picture&mdash;and
      again the Saint winked, with a most malicious smile. It was
      impossible to endure the repeated infliction, and Larry
      rushed down the stairs in an agony of fright and amazement.
      "May be," thought he, "it might be my own eyes that wasn't
      quite steady&mdash;or the flame of the candle. But
      no&mdash;he winked at me as plain as ever I winked at Judy
      Donaghue of a May morning. What he manes by it I can't
      say&mdash;but there's no use of thinking about it&mdash;no,
      nor of talking neither, for who' d believe me if I tould them
      of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening Sir Theodore died, as has been mentioned;
      and in due time thereafter was buried according to the custom
      of the family, by torch-light, in the churchyard of
      Inistubber. All was fitly performed; and although Dickenson
      had no design upon the jovial knight&mdash;and if he had not,
      there was nobody within fifteen miles that could be suspected
      of such an outrage,&mdash;yet Larry Sweeney was determined to
      make good his promise of watching his master. "I'd think
      little of telling a lie to him, by the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page348" name="page348"></a>[pg
      348]</span> way of no harm when he was alive," said he,
      wiping his eyes, as soon as the last of the train had
      departed, leaving him with a single companion in the lonely
      cemetery; "but now that he's dead&mdash;God rest his
      soul!&mdash;I'd scorn it. So Jack Kinaley, as behoves my
      first cousin's son, stay you with me here this blessed night,
      for betune (between) you and I, it an't lucky to stay by
      one's self in this ruinated old rookery, where ghosts, God
      help us, is as thick as bottles in Sir Theodore's cellar!"
      "Never you mind that, Larry," said Kinaley, a discharged
      soldier, who had been through all the campaigns of the
      Peninsula; "never mind, I say, such botherations. Han't I
      lain in bivouack on the field at Salamanca, and Tallawara,
      and the Pyrumnees, and many another place beside, where there
      was dead corpses lying about in piles, and there was no more
      ghosts than kneebuckles in a ridgemint of Highlanders. Here,
      let me prime them pieces, and hand us over the bottle; we'll
      stay snug under this east window, for the wind's coming down
      the hill, and I defy"&mdash;"None of that bould talk, Jack,"
      said his cousin; "as for what ye saw in foreign parts, of
      dead men killed afighting, sure that's nothing to the
      dead&mdash;God rest 'em!&mdash;that's here. There you see,
      they had company one with the other, and being killed
      fresh-like that morning, had no heart to stir; but here,
      faith! 'tis a horse of another colour." "May be it is," said
      Jack, "but the night's coming on; so I'll turn in. Wake me if
      you sees any thing; and after I've got my two hours' rest,
      I'll relieve you."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words the soldier turned on his side, under
      shelter of a grave, and as his libations had been rather
      copious during the day, it was not long before he gave
      audible testimony that the dread of supernatural visitants
      had had no effect in disturbing the even current of his
      fancy. Although Larry had not opposed the proposition of his
      kinsman, yet he felt by no means at ease. He put in practice
      all the usually recommended nostrums for keeping away
      unpleasant thoughts:&mdash;all would not do. "If it was a
      common, dacent, quite (quiet,) well-behaved churchyard
      a'self," thought Larry, half-aloud&mdash;"but when 'tis a
      place like this forsaken ould berrin'-ground, which is noted
      for villiany"&mdash;"For what, Larry?" said a gentleman,
      stepping out of a niche which contained the only statue time
      had spared. It was the figure of Saint Colman, to whom the
      church was dedicated. Larry had been looking at the figure,
      as it shone forth in ebon and ivory in the light and shadow
      of the now high-careering moon, "For what, Larry," said the
      gentleman,&mdash;"for what do you say the churchyard is
      noted?" "For nothing at all, plase your honour," replied
      Larry, "except the height of gentility." The stranger was
      about four feet high, dressed in what might be called flowing
      garments,&mdash;if, in spite of their form, their rigidity
      did not deprive them of all claim to such an appellation. He
      wore an antique mitre upon his head; his hands were folded
      upon his breast; and over his right shoulder rested a
      pastoral crook. There was a solemn expression in his
      countenance, and his eye might truly be called stony. His
      beard could not be well said to wave upon his bosom; but it
      lay upon it in ample profusion, stiffer than that of a Jew on
      a frosty morning after mist. In short, as Larry soon
      discovered to his horror, on looking up at the niche, it was
      no other than Saint Colman himself, who had stept forth,
      indignant (in all probability) at the stigma cast by the
      watcher of the dead on the churchyard of which his Saintship
      was patron. He smiled with a grisly solemnity&mdash;just such
      a smile as you might imagine would play round the lips of a
      milestone (if it had any,) at the recantation so quickly
      volunteered by Larry. "Well," said he, "Lawrence
      Sweeney"&mdash;"How well the old rogue," thought Larry,
      "knows my name!" "Since you profess yourself such an admirer
      of the merits of the churchyard of Inistubber, get up and
      follow me, till I show you the civilities of the
      place&mdash;for I am master here, and must do the honours."
      "Willingly would I go with your worship," replied our friend;
      "but you see here I am engaged to Sir Theodore, who, though a
      good master, was a mighty passionate man when every thing was
      not done as he ordered it; and I am feared to stir." "Sir
      Theodore," said the Saint, "will not blame you for following
      me. I assure you he will not." "But then," said
      Larry&mdash;"Follow me!" cried the Saint, in a hollow voice,
      and casting upon him his stony eye, drew poor Larry after
      him, as the bridal guest was drawn by the lapidary glance of
      the Ancient Mariner; or, as Larry himself afterwards
      expressed it, "as a jaw tooth is wrinched out of an ould
      woman with a pair of pinchers." The Saint strode before him
      in silence, not in the least incommoded by the stones and
      rubbish, which at every step sadly contributed to the
      discomfiture of Larry's shins, who followed his marble
      conductor into a low vault, situated at the west end of the
      church. The path lay through coffins piled up on each side of
      the way in various <span class="pagenum"><a id="page349"
      name="page349"></a>[pg 349]</span> degrees of decomposition;
      and, excepting that the solid footsteps of the saintly guide,
      as they smote heavily on the floor of stone, broke the deadly
      silence, all was still. Stumbling and staggering along,
      directed only by the casual glimpses of light afforded by the
      moon, where it broke through the dilapidated roof of the
      vault, and served to discover only sights of woe, Larry
      followed. He soon felt that he was descending, and could not
      help wondering at the length of the journey. He began to
      entertain the most unpleasant suspicions as to the character
      of his conductor;&mdash;but what could he do? Flight was out
      of the question, and to think of resistance was absurd.
      "Needs must, they say," thought he to himself, "when the
      devil drives. I see it's much the same when a saint, leads."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the dolorous march had an end; and not a little to
      Larry's amazement, he found that his guide had brought him to
      the gate of a lofty hall, before which a silver lamp, filled
      with naphtha, "yielded light as from a sky."&mdash;From
      within loud sounds of merriment were ringing; and it was
      evident, from the jocular harmony and the tinkling of
      glasses, that some subterraneous catch-club were not idly
      employed over the bottle. "Who's there?" said a porter,
      roughly responding to the knock of Saint Colman. "Be so
      good," said the Saint, mildly, "my very good fellow, as to
      open the door without further questions, or I'll break your
      head. I'm bringing a gentleman here on a visit, whose
      business is pressing." "May be so," thought Larry, "but what
      that business may be, is more than I can tell." The porter
      sulkily complied with the order, after having apparently
      communicated the intelligence that a stranger was at hand;
      for a deep silence immediately followed the tipsy clamour;
      and Larry, sticking close to his guide, whom he now looked
      upon almost as a friend, when compared with these underground
      revellers to whom he was about to be introduced, followed him
      through a spacious vestibule, which gradually sloped into a
      low-arched room, where the company was assembled. And a
      strange-looking company it was. Seated round a long table
      were three-and-twenty grave and venerable personages,
      bearded, mitred, stoled, and croziered,&mdash;all living
      statues of stone, like the Saint who had walked out of his
      niche. On the drapery before them were figured the images of
      the sun, moon, and stars&mdash;the inexplicable
      bear&mdash;the mystic temple, built by the hand of
      Hiram&mdash;and other symbols, of which the uninitiated knew
      nothing. The square, the line, the trowel, were not wanting,
      and the hammer was lying in front of the chair. Labour,
      however, was over, and the time for refreshment having
      arrived, each of the stony brotherhood had a flagon before
      him; and when we mention that the Saints were Irish, and that
      St. Patrick in person was in the chair, it is not to be
      wondered at that the mitres, in some instances, hung rather
      loosely on the side of the heads of some of the canonized
      compotators. Among the company were found St. Senanus of
      Limerick, St. Declan of Ardmore, St. Canice of Kilkenny, St.
      Finbar of Cork, St. Michan of Dublin, St. Brandon of Kerry,
      St. Fachnan of Ross, and others of that holy brotherhood; a
      vacant place, which completed the four-and-twentieth, was
      left for St. Colman, who, as every body knows, is of Cloyne;
      and he, having taken his seat, addressed the president, to
      inform him that he had brought the man. The man (viz. Larry
      himself) was awestruck with the company in which he so
      unexpectedly found himself; and trembled all over when, on
      the notice of his guide, the eight-and-forty eyes of stone
      were turned directly upon himself. "You have just nicked the
      night to a shaving, Larry," said St. Patrick: "this is our
      chapter-night, and myself and brethren are here 'assembled on
      merry occasion.'&mdash;You know who I am?" "God bless your
      reverence," said Larry, "it's I that do well. Often did I see
      your picture hanging over the door of places where it
      is"&mdash;lowering his voice&mdash;"pleasanter to be than
      here, buried under an ould church." "You may as well say it
      out, Larry," said St. Patrick; "and don't think I'm going to
      be angry with you about it; for I was once flesh and blood
      myself. But you remember, the other night, saying that you
      would think nothing of pulling your master out of purgatory,
      if you could get at him there, and appealing to me to stand
      by your words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Y-e-e-s," said Larry, most mournfully; for he recollected
      the significant look he had received from the picture. "And,"
      continued St. Patrick, "you remember also that I gave you a
      wink, which you know is as good, any day, as a nod&mdash;at
      least, to a blind horse." "I'm sure, your reverence," said
      Larry, with a beating heart, "is too much of a gintleman to
      hould a poor man hard to every word he may say of an evening,
      and therefore"&mdash;"I was thinking so," said the saint, "I
      guessed you'd prove a poltroon when put to the push. What do
      you think, my brethren, I should do to this fellow?" A hollow
      sound burst from the bosoms of the unanimous assembly.
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>[pg
      350]</span> The verdict was short and decisive:&mdash;"Knock
      out his brains!" And in order to suit the action to the word,
      the whole four-and-twenty arose at once, and with their
      immovable eyes fixed firmly on the face of our hero&mdash;who
      horror struck with the sight as he was, could not close
      his&mdash;they began to glide slowly but regularly towards
      him, bending their line into the form of a crescent, so as to
      environ him on all sides. In vain he fled to the door; its
      massive folds resisted mortal might. In vain he cast his eyes
      around in quest of a loophole of retreat&mdash;there was
      none. Closer and closer pressed on the slowly-moving phalanx,
      and the uplifted croziers threatened soon to put their
      sentence into execution. Supplication was all that
      remained&mdash;and Larry sunk upon his knees. "Ah! then,"
      said he, "gintlemin and ancient ould saints as you are, don't
      kill the father of a large small family, who never did hurt
      to you or yours. Sure, if 'tis your will that I should go
      to&mdash;no matter who, for there's no use in naming his
      name&mdash;might I not as well make up my mind to go there,
      alive and well, stout and hearty, and able to face
      him,&mdash;as with my head knocked into bits, as if I had
      been after a fair or a patthern?" "You say right," said St.
      Patrick, checking with a motion of his crozier the advancing
      assailants, who returned to their seats. "I am glad to see
      you coming to reason. Prepare for your journey." "And how,
      plase your Saintship, am I to go?" asked Larry. "Why," said
      St. Patrick, "as Colman here has guided you so far, he may
      guide you further. But as the journey is into foreign parts,
      where you arn't likely to be known, you had better take this
      letter of introduction, which may be of use to you." "And
      here, also, Lawrence," said a Dublin Saint&mdash;perhaps
      Michan&mdash;"take you this box also, and make use of it as
      he to whom you speak shall suggest." "Take a hold, and a firm
      one," said St. Colman, "Lawrence, of my cassock, and we' ll
      start." "All right behind?" cried St. Patrick. "All right!"
      was the reply. In an
      instant!&mdash;vault&mdash;table&mdash;saints&mdash;bell&mdash;church,
      faded into air; a rustling hiss of wings was all that was
      heard; and Larry felt his cheek swept by a current, as if a
      covey of birds of enormous size were passing him. (It was, in
      all probability, the flight of the saints returning to
      heaven, but on that point nothing certain has reached us up
      to the present time of writing.) He had not a long time to
      wonder at the phenomenon, for he himself soon began to soar,
      dangling in mid sky at the skirt of the cassock of his
      sainted guide. Earth, and all that appertains thereto,
      speedily passed from his eyes, and they were alone in the
      midst of circumfused ether, glowing with a sunless light.
      Above, in immense distance, was fixed the firmament, fastened
      up with bright stars, fencing around the world with its azure
      wall. They fled far, before any distinguishable object met
      their eyes. At length a long, white streak, shining like
      silver in the moonbeam, was visible to their sight. "That,"
      said St. Colman, "is the Limbo which adjoins the earth, and
      is the highway for ghosts departing the world. It is called
      in Milton, a book which I suppose, Larry, you never have
      read"&mdash;"And how could I, plase your worship," said
      Larry, "seein' I don't know a B from a bull's foot!" "Well,
      it is called in Milton the Paradise of Fools: and if it were
      indeed peopled by all of that tribe who leave the world, it
      would contain the best company that ever figured on the
      earth. To the north, you see a bright speck?" "I do." "That
      marks the upward path,&mdash;narrow and hard to find. To the
      south you may see a darksome road&mdash;broad, smooth, and
      easy of descent; that is the lower way. It is thronged with
      the great ones of the world; you may see their figures in the
      gloom. Those who are soaring upwards are wrapt in the flood
      of light flowing perpetually from that single spot, and you
      cannot see them. The silver path on which we enter is the
      Limbo. Here I part with you. You are to give your letter to
      the first person you meet. Do your best;&mdash;be courageous,
      but observe particularly that you profane no holy name, or I
      will not answer for the consequences."
    </p>
    <p>
      His guide had scarcely vanished, when Larry heard the
      tinkling of a bell in the distance, and turning his eyes in
      the quarter whence it proceeded, he saw a grave-looking man
      in black, with eyes of fire, driving before him a flock of
      ghosts with a switch, as you see turkeys driven on the
      western road, at the approach of Christmas. They were on the
      highway to Purgatory. The ghosts were shivering in the thin
      air, which pinched them severely, now that they had lost the
      covering of their bodies. Among the group, Larry recognised
      his old master, by the same means that Ulysses, Aeneas, and
      others, recognised the bodiless forms of their friends in the
      regions of Acheron. "What brings a living person," said the
      man in black, "on this pathway? I shall make legal capture of
      you, Larry Sweeney, for trespassing. You have no business
      here." "I have come," said Larry, plucking up courage, "to
      bring <span class="pagenum"><a id="page351"
      name="page351"></a>[pg 351]</span> your honour's glory a
      letter from a company of gintlemin with whom I had the
      pleasure of spending the evening, underneath the ould church
      of Inistubber." "A letter," said the man in black, "where is
      it?" "Here, my lord," said Larry. "Ho!" cried the black
      gentleman, on opening it, "I know the handwriting. It won't
      do, however, my lad,&mdash;I see they want to throw dust in
      my eyes." "Whew," thought Larry, "that's the very thing. 'Tis
      for that the ould Dublin boy gave me the box. I'd lay a
      tinpenny to a brass farthing that it's filled with Lundy
      Foot." Opening the box, therefore, he flung its contents
      right into the fiery eyes of the man in black, while he was
      still occupied with reading the letter,&mdash;and the
      experiment was successful.
      "Curses&mdash;tche-tche-tche,&mdash; Curses on it," exclaimed
      he, clapping his hand before his eyes, and sneezing most
      lustily.&mdash;"Run, you villians, run," cried Larry, to the
      ghosts&mdash;"run, you villians, now that his eyes are off of
      you&mdash;O master, master! Sir Theodore, jewel! run to the
      right-hand side, make for the bright speck, and God give you
      luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten his injunction. The moment the word was
      uttered he felt the silvery ground sliding from under him;
      and with the swiftness of thought he found himself on the
      flat of his back, under the very niche of the old church wall
      whence he had started, dizzy and confused with a measureless
      tumble. The emancipated ghosts floated in all directions,
      emitting their shrill and stridulous cries in the gleaming
      expanse. Some were again gathered by their old conductor;
      some scudding about at random, took the right hand path,
      others the left. Into which of them Sir Theodore struck, is
      not recorded; but as he had heard the direction, let us hope
      that he made the proper choice. Larry had not much time given
      him to recover from his fall, for almost in an instant he
      heard an angry snorting rapidly approaching, and looking up,
      whom should he see but the gentleman in black, with eyes
      gleaming more furiously than ever, and his horns (for, in his
      haste, he had let his hat fall) relieved in strong shadow
      against the moon. Up started Larry&mdash;away ran his pursuer
      after him. The safest refuge was, of course, the
      church,&mdash;thither ran our hero&mdash;and after
      him&mdash;fiercer than the shark, swifter than the
      hounds&mdash;fled the black gentleman. The church is cleared;
      the chancel entered; and the hot breath of his pursuer glows
      upon the outstretched neck of Larry. Escape is
      impossible&mdash;the extended talons of the fiend have
      clutched him by the hair. "You are mine," cried the
      demon,&mdash;"if I have lost any of my flock, I have at last
      got you." "Oh, St. Patrick!" exclaimed our hero, in horror,
      &mdash;"Oh, St. Patrick have mercy upon me, and save me!" "I
      tell you what, cousin Larry," said Kinaley, chucking him up
      from behind a gravestone, where he had fallen&mdash;"all the
      St. Patricks that ever were born would not have saved you
      from ould Tom Picton, if he caught you sleeping on your post
      as I've caught you now. By the word of an ould soldier, he'd
      have had the provost-marshal upon you, and I'd not give
      two-pence for the loan of your life. And then, too, I see you
      have drunk every drop in the bottle. What can you say for
      yourself?" "Nothing at all," said Larry, scratching his
      head,&mdash;"but it was an unlucky dream, and I'm glad it's
      over."&mdash;<i>Literary Souvenir.</i>

      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Epulum Jovis</i> was a sumptuous feast offered to
      Jupiter on the 13th of November. The gods were formally
      invited, and attended; for the statues were brought in rich
      beds, furnished with soft pillows, called <i>pulvinaria</i>.
      Thus accommodated, their godships were placed on their
      couches at the most honourable part of the table, and served
      with the rich dainties, as if they were able to eat; but the
      <i>epulones</i>, or ministers, who had the care and
      management of the feast, performed that function for them,
      and no doubt did the part of <i>gastronomic proxies</i> with
      <i>eclat</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Brumalia</i> was a feast of Bacchus, celebrated among
      the Romans during the space of thirty days, commencing on the
      24th of November. It was instituted by Romulus, who used,
      during this time, to entertain the senate. During this feast
      indications were taken of the felicity of the remaining part
      of the winter.

      AN AGITATOR.

    <p>
      M. Monchenut, an old man of eighty, afflicted with the palsy,
      was arrested during the reign of terror, under suspicion of
      being an agitator. Being asked what he had to say to the
      accusation, "Alas, gentlemen, it is very true, I am agitated
      enough, God knows, for I have not been able to keep a limb
      still for these fifteen years."

      CHINESE POLITENESS.

      There is one striking particular in which the Chinese
      politeness is quite the reverse of ours. To take off their
      caps when they salute one another, or even accidentally to
      appear uncovered, is esteemed the height of ill breeding and
      indecency.

        The portion of this temple which is still standing in the
        Campo Vaccino, and which consists of three marble columns,
        with a fragment of entablature, is universally acknowledged
        to be the finest specimen, not only of the architecture of
        the Augustan age, but of the Corinthian order, not merely
        in Rome, but throughout the whole ancient world. Whether
        contemplated in the original, or through the medium of
        drawings, it inspires unequivocal admiration as a perfect
        model of the florid style: and from the inferences
        deducible from the dimensions and relative position of the
        three columns and their entablature, it is clear that the
        elegance and propriety of their arrangement, as members of
        an entire edifice, were equal to the grace of the
        proportions of the still existing parts, and to the beauty,
        however exquisite, of their enrichments.

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
